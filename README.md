# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for a personal portfolio website.  
The layout uses a **Masonry Grid style** (similar to Pinterest), optimized for showcasing creative works. From pics to videos. 

## Features
- Responsive design with Masonry Grid layout  
- Light/Dark mode toggle  
- Image & video gallery with popup viewer  
- Basic slideshow functionality  

## Notes
The code is still a work-in-progress.  
It can definitely be developed further to be **more dynamic and efficient**.  
Feel free to fork, modify, and experiment with it for your own portfolio or projects.
